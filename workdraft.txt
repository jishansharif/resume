Medsender:
Code coverage-> There are different methods to transfer data in Medsender. These are:
    Sending a document to a medsender user. It will directly be stored in the user's portal
    Sending a document to a non medsender user. A link will be sent to the receipient directing them to a secure medsender viewer
    Sending a document through a fax number. 
    We wanted to refactor the way this was implemented, Before we were able to do that, I was given
    the task to check the code coverage. Had to create test cases to ensure each line of code gets hit and is working correctly


Forgot/Update Password -> As our number of customers grew, we had to implement a new implementation to reset user's 
passwords. Currently, Users would have to call us directly and we'd have to manually change their password. I was part
of the team that created the frontend and backend UI flow to reset a user's password.

Filtering system -> A user may receive documents from medsender users, non medsender users through email or through a number.
These documents are all stored in the same portal, navigating through them can be tedious if the number of documents received are too many.
I've worked on the FE and BE for deveoping a filtering system, where user's can enter a sender's name, or filter the number of documents according to 
different categories such as "Received via fax" , "Received via email", "Received via medsender user"

Signature Feature:
A very important feature we wanted to implement was giving the users the ability to edit documents. With this feature, a user can receive a document,
edit the document, and send the edited document to other people. I was respoinsible for creating the BE implementation for this task


Saving Signatures:

Once we implemented the signature feature (the ability to edit documents), We wanted a way to save the user's signatures, instead of having to write
it multiple times. I led a team to implement this functionality. We also used bench mark testing to find the best algorithm for this process.

Had to use Postman to test endpoints. We saved these documents in the google cloud server. For all these points, I had to extensively work
with rails db and multiple model, controller files.


Clienttable:
    1) Update contact information: Was given the tasks to load user's information. Previously, the user information wouldnt be stored, multiple
    components of our app were broken, I was in charge to make these fixes.

    2) Enhanced UI for home page and more: Worked on Figma to design new templates for the main app. Used Node and React to implement these designs.



About whitted ray tracer:
    1) Implementation of a turner whitted ray tracer. Generate virtual images by following a path from the light to the camera.
    2) Simulate effects such as caustics or reflection of light from other surfaces in the scene.
